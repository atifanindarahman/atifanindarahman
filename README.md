Geospatial Data Science | Open-Source GIS

I am a graduate student in **Geographic Information Science and Cartography** at the University of Denver with a background in **geospatial data science, spatial modeling, and environmental analytics**.

My work focuses on **open-source geospatial workflows**, integrating **Python-based analysis, QGIS-compatible processing, and large spatial datasets** to support **infrastructure planning, and environmental decision-making**.


## Technical Focus
- Geospatial data science & spatial modeling    
- Raster & vector processing using open-source tools  
- Scientific programming and reproducible workflows  


## Tools & Technologies
- **Python** (NumPy, Pandas, SciPy, Matplotlib)
- GeoPandas, Shapely, PyProj, GDAL  
- **QGIS**
- Google Earth Engine  
- Machine Learning (CNNs, large image datasets)
